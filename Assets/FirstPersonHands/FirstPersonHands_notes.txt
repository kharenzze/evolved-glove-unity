Thank you for Purchasing the First person hands asset.

This has recently been updated with generic animations that you can animate independantly for unique motions. 
It is reccommended that you also animate things in a secondary sense by attaching the arms to an game object that will have its own animation, this will helpfor finetuning positioning.
Animations may also be switched to generic mode to allow for mechanim from the Rig tab.
Many animation speeds will also need tweaking for better visual performance in your game.

This pack is an update and includes new animations and textures and also a new mixer shader for blending between the blood and non-bloody versions of the texture.
